RaiseAttention is an exception flow analyser that identifies if any of your python code
have unhandled exceptions, even if you think they are.

It also is a LSP server that will give you errors when you are calling a function
that may raise an exception. The laziest way to appease RA is to do a
`try: ... except Exception:` block to catch all exceptions.

Depending on your codebase, you may want to use generic wrapper functions to handle
them as per your needs.

The idea is that you won't have to ~~worry about exceptions anymore~~ live in the dark
when it comes to if any functions you use may call an exception you didn't expect or
know about.

To decide what Python to use, it looks for a virtual environment, based on the
[pseudospec generated by Perplexity](resources/VENV_DETECTION.md).
